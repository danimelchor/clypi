# ü¶Ñ Term

Type-safe Python CLI prompts with validations, retries, custom messages, etc.

### Examples

Check out the examples in `./examples`! You can run them locally with:
```
uv run examples/colors.py
uv run examples/spinner.py
uv run examples/prompt.py
```

## ‚ùì Prompting

First, you'll need to import the `term` module:
```python
import term
answer = term.prompt(
    "Are you going to use Term?",
    default=True,
    parser=bool
)
```

## üåà Colors
```python
import term

# Style text
print(term.style("This is blue", fg="blue"), "and", term.style("this is red", fg="red"))

# Print with colors directly
term.print("Some colorful text", bg="magenta", bold=True, italic=True)

# Store a styler and reuse it
wrong = term.styler(fg="red", strikethrough=True)
print("The old version said", wrong("Pluto was a planet"))
print("The old version said", wrong("the Earth was flat"))
```

## üåÄ Spinners

```python
import asyncio
from term import Spinner

async def main():
    async with Spinner("Downloading assets") as s:
        for i in range(1, 6):
            await asyncio.sleep(0.5)
            s.title = f"Downloading assets [{i}/5]"

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Ôíâ Parsing CLI args

**Integration with argparse**
```python
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
_ = parser.add_argument("--animal", type=str)
args = parser.parse_args()
animal = term.prompt("What's your favorite animal?", provided=args.animal)
```

## üêç Type-checking

This library is fully type-checked. This means that all types will be correctly inferred
from the arguments you pass in.

In this example your editor will correctly infer the type:
```python
hours = term.prompt(
    "How many hours are there in a day?",
    klass=k.TimeDelta() | k.Str() | k.Int(),
)
reveal_type(hours)  # Type of "res" is "timedelta | str | int"
```

In some cases, like prompting, the type will also indicate how to validate and parse the passed argument.
For example, the following code will validate that the passed input is a valid number:
```python
age = term.prompt("What's your age?", klass=int)
```


## Why do I care?

Type checking will help you catch issues way earlier in the development cycle. It will also
provide nice autocomplete features in your editor that will make you faster Û±êã.
